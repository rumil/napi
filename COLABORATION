Bashnapi is an open project I accept pull requests gladly. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate or post a patch for this project.

Rules of thumb:
===============

- Always fork the dev branch (your changes before merged to master will be merged there). dev represents current development state of the project and contains the newest code.

- Before posting a patch TEST it. Perform some manual verification first and use bashnapi test environment to verify if your delivery didn't brake anything else.

- Write tests for your code (refer to test suite's readme under tests/ subdirectory for more details)

- If using any different editor than vim, remember to use correct indendation settings:
-- use spaces instead of TABS for indendation
-- indendation depth = 4 spaces
